# OnlineFoodDeliveryApp
This is a online food delivery app. Here people can order food from different restaurent.

Brief Description – This is the business model for our new online food delivery application (Like Zomato), but we are focusing on a local region-based delivery system in our case it's for Exeter city so the client can have access to all food restaurants and franchise access with category-based division. Our application is named as GetfoodOnline. Due to covid pandemic lockdown and E-commerce field growth, this organization sees the upcoming opportunity in the online food delivery system. We are also adding some customer interaction features (like Feedback and Wishlist) in our database system.  

 

Application – This application is the shared module between Restaurant and client database. The main use of this application is to simplify the user experience while ordering food online rather then complex and confusing loaded application. We have the database of the local restaurant only and categorize them based on the user food cuisine requirement. And that we can achieve this by using the best set of RDBMS and NoSQL data-based and presenting a demo with Python-based IDE.
